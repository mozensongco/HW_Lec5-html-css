Welcome to the soft opening of the Spook Saloon!

At present, the Spook Saloon's intended design is as a sort of personal blog
centered specifically around my various TTRPG experiences and characters.
I may also eventually make this website a portfolio of my creative content
and add more of my owm links and assets in the future.

(This also means that a lot of the actual content on the site is still placeholder content,
because I just don't have the time to write that much right now.)

Changes from the previous version:
- Search icon and shopping cart assets removed (for now)
+ Spook Saloon navbar logo text added
+ Logo animations added
= Navbar and footer design code updated (design is consistent with previous version)
= Character gallery image code updated (design is consistent with previous version)


Planned future changes:
* Replace "What's that system?" nav link with a dropdown menu for various systems,
  each with their own page
* A "Spook Saloon Staff" page
* Replace Character Gallery images with icons + descriptions for the characters
* A page housing blog posts.
* A search bar and tagging system.
